# Unit-4-Game

This is the first assignment utilizing jQuery.

## What the project does 

This project served as a test case for using jQuery I had recently learned. I also have tried out SweetAlert to modify the basic browser alerts.

## Why the project is useful 

The project helped me clarify a lot of the logic when writing in JavaScript.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project 

Hmm. Pretty sure this is just me.
